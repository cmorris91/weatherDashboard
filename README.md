# weatherDashboard

Created a simple weather page that:

Takes what city a user types in and does a fetch request to a weather api

from that api it pulls current weather data which includes: temperature, humidity, date, uv index and sky conditons

It also gathers 5 days of future weather conditions

All of that information is rendered to the page

The users previously typed in cities are saved and rendered back onto the page in a list format

That list can be clicked on for same weather conditions
